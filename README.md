# Beer Locker

A tutorial application built by Scott Smith (scottsmith.com).

Everything seems to go well until I got to the 4th part of the series
(http://scottksmith.com/blog/2014/07/02/beer-locker-building-a-restful-api-with-node-oauth2-server/).
As a side-project, I am considering refactoring the code, writing some instructions that I would
find more clear, and publishing these in a blog post.
